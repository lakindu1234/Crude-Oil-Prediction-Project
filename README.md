# Crude-Oil-Prediction-Project


This is a Web application that predicts Crude oil Prices based on historical data and various economic indicators. The model is trained on a dataset. I used flask for backend and html , css, js for the frontend. I hopes to host this backend in AWS and frontend in Vercel.
